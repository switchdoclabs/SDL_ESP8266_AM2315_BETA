/***************************************************
  Heavily modified by SwitchDoc Labs for reliablity
  February 2018 and in 2017


  This is a library for the AM2315 Humidity Pressure & Temp Sensor

  Designed specifically to work with the AM2315 sensor from Adafruit
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/1293

  These displays use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to
  interface
  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
  please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
  products from Adafruit!
